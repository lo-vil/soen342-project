1.	Each sensor deployed by the system must have a unique id:

context SensorSystem
inv:	self.sensorRegistry.sensors -> forAll( s1, s2 | s1 <> s2  implies  s1._ID <> s2._ID)

2.	All sensors deployed in the system are sensors that are maintained by the system:

context SensorSystem
inv:	self.sensors -> forAll( s | SensorSystem.SensorRegistry.sensors -> includes(s))

3.	Every deployed sensor must be associated with a location that exists in the corresponding location registry:
	
context SensorSystem
inv: 	self.SensorRegistry.sensors -> forAll( s | self.SensorLocationPairings.sensors -> includes(s))

4.	Every location maintained by the system is associated with a unique sensor.

context SensorSystem
inv : 	self.Locations -> forAll(l | l.sensor -> size() = 1)
